# Setup

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - you need to have a project there.

Install the deps with `npm install`.

Copy `src/environments/environment.ts` to `src/environments/environment.development.ts` and fill the values. Get them from Supabase (click the `Connect` button in the top navigation).
